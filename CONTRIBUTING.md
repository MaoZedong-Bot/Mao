## I Have a Question

If able, contact us in the Discord DMs listed in PRIVACY.md or via email at mzedong.bot@gmail.com. If not, create an issue:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/MaoZedong-Bot/Mao/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions.

We will take care of the issue whenever we read that tab (never).

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

We ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps before reporting an issue to make it easier for everyone.

- Make sure you're running the latest version of the bot.
- Determine if your issue really is a bug and not an issue on your side, such as outdated packages, own modifications or similar. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- Check that there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [issues tab](https://github.com/MaoZedong-Bot/Mao/issues).
- Collect information about the bug:
   - Logs (logs/debug.log and logs/errors.log)
   - Operating System / Environment
   - Node.js and npm versions
   - The input that caused the issue
   - Steps to reproduce the bug

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to mzedong.bot@gmail.com.

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/MaoZedong-Bot/Mao/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- We will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. 
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).


### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Mao Zedong, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. 

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/MaoZedong-Bot/Mao/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Think if your idea is within the project's scope, if not, make a fork.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/MaoZedong-Bot/Mao/issues).

- Use a**lear and descriptive title**
- Provide as many details as possible
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and the built-in [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
